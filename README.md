MERN Stack Blood Bank App

Project Overview

The MERN Stack Blood Bank App is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management and coordination of blood donations and distributions. 
Leveraging the capabilities of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), this project aims to streamline the process for both donors and blood bank
administrators, ensuring efficient tracking and accessibility of blood resources.
